# Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio project built by Michel Merheb.

## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a front-end developer. The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, Media Queries, and basic JavaScript.

## Features

- **Home Page:** Introduces visitors to the portfolio.
- **About Page:** Includes information about me, my skills, and experiences. Basic JavaScript functionality is implemented to showcase my JavaScript skills, although It was not necessay, I included it in a creative and playful way.
- **Projects Page:** Displays a selection of my projects and links to view more details.
- **Contact Page:** Offers a contact form for visitors to get in touch with me.
- **Media Queries:** Made the navigations links and the projects card to be responsive on many devices.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Media Queries
- JavaScript

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/michelmerheb/Portfolio`
2. Open the project folder.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the portfolio.


### Decisions Made

- **Framework Choice:** As an intern with limited experience, I chose not to use React.js for this project due to the limited time. Instead, I focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and basics of JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Although it was recommended, I didn't integrate Tailwind CSS into the project because of time limitations. I plan to dedicate time this week to learn it thoroughly.

  
### Challenges Faced and Solutions

- **Time Constraints:** With only two days to complete the assignment, time management was crucial. I prioritized essential features and functionality to ensure timely completion.
- **Tailwind CSS Integration:** Due to the limited time available, I couldn't learn and implement Tailwind CSS effectively. Instead, I focused on refining my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create a functional and visually appealing portfolio.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate Tailwind CSS for more efficient styling and layout management.
- Implement additional JavaScript functionality to enhance user experience and interactivity.
